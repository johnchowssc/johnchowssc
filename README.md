- 👋 Hi, I’m a bad programmer.
- 👀 I’m interested in (re) learning how to code. I first left technical work more than a decade ago. Once knew Java, microprocessor/assembly, C, C++, HTML, R, enterprise CRM
- 🌱 I’m learning swift, python, and test-driven development. Now I know nothing.
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on anything.
- 📫 How to reach me: message me here, or at john.chow@sydneysabre.com
